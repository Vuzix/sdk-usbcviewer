# Vuzix USB-C Viewer Android Support
## Overview
This SDK allows Android developers to integrate the Vuzix USB-C Viewers into an application running on an Android smart phone.

Please note that Vuzix smart glasses fall into two categories:
1. Stand-alone smart glasses, such as the M400, which are *not* supported by this SDK.
2. USB-C Viewers, such as the M400C, for which this SDK is intended.

The USB-C Viewer must be connected via a USB-C cable to an Android phone supporting USB-C DisplayPort Alt Mode.

## Supported Features
1. Display - The display is automatically detected by the phone. No SDK methods are required to support this.
2. Audio - The microphones and speaker are automatically detected by the phone. No SDK methods are required to support this.
3. Button input - The buttons are delivered to your application as
[Android Key Events](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/KeyEvent).
4. Touchpad input - The touchpad interaction is delivered to your application as
[Android Motion Events](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/MotionEvent).
5. Orientation Sensor - The SDK provides access to the proprietary data format of the USB-C Viewer orientation sensor in a
similar manner to [Android Sensor Events](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEvent).
6. Flashlight - The SDK provides the ability to turn the flashlight on the USB-C viewer on and off.
7. Camera - The USB-C Viewer camera acts as a standard UVC camera, and can be accessed using standard UVC camera APIs.

## Installation
Most developers should use the stable pre-built libraries to get the required SDK behavior. You may integrate the Vuzix USB-C
Viewer SDK into an Android development project by referencing the appropriate Maven artifacts.

For gradle projects, specify the repository in your root gradle:

```
allprojects {
  repositories {
	  ...
	  maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
  }
}
```

And add the dependecy to your project gradle:

```
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.vuzix:sdk-usbcviewer:0.0.1'
}
```

For a full list of available release tags, and syntax to add to non-gradle projects, please see our
[Jitpack Package Repository](https://jitpack.io/#com.vuzix/sdk-usbcviewer).

Then ensure the following line is in your `AndroidManifest.xml` to declare that you use the USB feature for your app:

`<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.usb.host" />`

Optionally, you can also add an `intent-filter` within your `activity` tag to automatically launch your app when the
USB-C Viewer is connected to the phone:

```xml
<activity>
    <intent-filter>
        <action android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED" />
    </intent-filter>
    <meta-data android:name="android.hardware.usb.action.USB_DEVICE_ATTACHED"
        android:resource="@xml/device_filter" />
</activity>
```

## Usage

### Common
The SDK exposes functionality of the external hardware. You must explicitly connect to each interface before it may be used. Do so by calling
`connect()` on the appropriate interface class.

If the USB-C Viewer is not available, the `connect()` call will throw an exception.  You may optionally query `isDeviceAvailable()` prior
to `connect()` to prevent this.

Close the connection by calling `disconnect()` when the interface is no longer required.

To track whether or not you have connected you may evaluate the `connected` boolean property. 

A sample of that flow, minus exception handling, might look like:

```
if( !usbcInterface.connected ) {
	if( usbcInterface.isDeviceAvailable() ) {
		usbcInterface.connect();
	}
}
//todo: do something with the interface while connected, then
if( usbcInterface.connected ) {
	usbcInterface.disconnect();
}
```

### Flashlight
The Flashlight interface is `com.vuzix.sdk.usbcviewer.flashlight.Flashlight`.

The Flashlight interface class will allow you to toggle the ON/OFF state of the device Flashlight.

Once a connection is initialized you may simply call `turnFlashlightOn()` and `turnFlashlightOff()`.

### Sensors
The Sensors interface is `com.vuzix.sdk.usbcviewer.sensors.Sensors`.

The Sensors interface class will allow you to receive data from the device sensors. They come back in the following formats:

* Accelerometer: *meters per second squared*
* Gyrometer: *degrees per second*
* Magnetometer/Compass: *Âµ Teslas*

The `Sensors` object requires a `VuzixSensorListener`. This is very similar to an
[Android SensorEventListener](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/SensorEventListener) and all results are given to
the `onSensorChanged()` method. `VuzixSensorListener` also adds an `onSensorInitialized()` to know when the asynchronous initialization completes on the
device, and an `onError()` in case the initialization fails or the device disconnects after being initialized.

Once the connection is established, you will need to enable the sensors by calling `initializeSensors()`.

Once the sensor data is initialized, you will receive the data in the form of a `VuzixSensorEvent` object. This contains a `sensorType`
value of type `Sensor.TYPE_ACCELEROMETER`, `Sensor.TYPE_MAGNETIC_FIELD`, or `Sensor.TYPE_GYROSCOPE`.

The data is stored in the `values` array and the axis corresponds as such:
* `values[0]` = x-axis
* `values[1]` = y-axis
* `values[2]` = z-axis

The axes returned by the SDK are defined according to the standard [Android Mobile Device Axes](https://source.android.com/devices/sensors/sensor-types)
when the device being worn on the right eye. Note: The axes from the SDK different are different than the raw data described in the M400C data sheet.
